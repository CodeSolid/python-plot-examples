# Interactive Plotting in Python 

This directory contains two companion notebooks, one that consolidates the code, and one that goes step by step to match the article [Creating a Python Interactive Plot Using Matplotlib in Jupyter](https://codesolid.com/creating-a-python-interactive-plot/).

See that article for complete usage directions, but basic usage is to create a virtual environment, then into it, ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
