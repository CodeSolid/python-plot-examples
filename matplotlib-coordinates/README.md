# Configuring Matplotlib Coordinates

This is the companion project to the article [Matplotlib Coordinates: Graphing Math Functions in Python](https://codesolid.com/matplotlib-coordinates-toward-a-python-graphing-calculator/).

The Notebook contains the source and plots on which the article was based, and shows how to graph plain Python functions that produce Linear and Non-Linear results in MatplotLib.
